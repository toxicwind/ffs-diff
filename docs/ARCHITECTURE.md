```

## Flow

- **Diff mode** `bin/ffs-diff a b [--full]`
  1. `getOutline` shells to `ffs outline --format json` (code) or walks the
     heading tree (markdown).
  2. `buildSignatureMap` keys symbols as `kind:name`.
  3. `diffSignatures(base, next)` → added / removed / changed. `--full` adds a
     unified line preview via `simpleDiff`.

- **Merge mode** `bin/ffs-diff base ours theirs --merge`
  1. `fastForward` short-circuits when one side equals base (auto-clean).
  2. `mergeThree` runs `git merge-file -p ours base theirs` — battle-tested
     diff3 with base anchoring.
  3. Conflict markers `<<<<<<< ours / ======= / >>>>>>> theirs`; `conflicts`
     is the open-marker count. Exit `0` clean / `1` conflicts.

## Design decisions

- **git for diff3, not a hand-rolled LCS** — a naive per-base-line alignment
  double-emits shared context lines when LCS tie-breaking misfires on adjacent
  edits. Git's merge engine is guaranteed present and correct.
- **ffs for structure** — borrow the codebase's tree-sitter index instead of
  shipping another parser.
- **Modules over monolith** — each responsibility is `require`-able so other
  estate tools embed the API without shelling to a CLI.
